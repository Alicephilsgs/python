Question 1
Ask the user for two numbers between 1 and 100. Then count from the
lower number to the higher number. Print the results to the screen.
'''
num_1=int(input('Please enter a number between 1 and 100: '))
num_2=int(input('Please enter a number between 1 and 100: '))

while num_1<0 or num_2<0 or num_1>100 or num_2>100 or num_1==num_2:
    print('the two number should be between 1 and 100 and different, try again')
    num_1=int(input('Please enter a number between 1 and 100: '))
    num_2=int(input('Please enter a number between 1 and 100: '))

        print(i,end=' ')
else:
    for i in range(num_2,num_1+1):
        print(i,end=' ')

'''
Question 2
Ask the user to input a string and then print it out to the screen in
reverse order (use a for loop).
'''

word=input('Please enter a word: ')
print(word[::-1])


'''
Question 3
Ask the user for a number between 1 and 12 and then display a times
table for that number.
'''
num=input('Please enter a number between 1 and 12: ')

while (not num.isdigit()) or int(num)<1 or int(num)>12:
    print('Must be an integer between 1 and 12, try again!')
    num=input('Please enter a number between 1 and 12: ')
num=int(num)
print()
print("=================")
print(f'this is the {num} times table')
print()
for i in range(1,13):
    print(f'{num} x {i} = {num*i}')
    

'''
Question 4
Can you amend the solution to question 3 so that it just prints out all
times tables between 1 and 12? (no  need to ask user for input)
'''

for i in range(1,13):
    print('======================')
    print()
    print(f'this is {i} times table')
    print()
    for num in range(1,13):
        print(f'{i} x {num} = {i*num}')
        
'''
Question 5
Ask the user to input a sequence of numbers. Then calculate the mean
and print the result
'''

user_input=input('please input a number: ')
number=[]
while user_input.lower() != 'exit':
    while not user_input.isdigit():
        print('That is not a number, number please')
        user_input=input('try again: ')
    number.append(int(user_input))
    user_input=input('please input another number: ')

print(f'mean is {sum(number)/len(number)}')
    
    

'''
Question 6
Write code that will calculate 15 factorial. (factorial is product of
positive ints up to a given number. e.g 5 factorial is 5x4x3x2x1)
'''
factorial=1
for i in range(1,16):
    factorial*=i 
print(f'the factorial of 15 is {factorial}')
    
'''
Question 7
Write code to calculate Fibonacci numbers. Create list containing
first 20 Fibonacci numbers, (Fib  numbers made by sum of preceeding
two. Series starts 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ....)
'''

n=20

a=0
b=1
total=[]
for i in range(n):
    total.append(a)

Question 10
Write some code that will determine all odd and even numbers
between 1 and 100. Put the odds in a list named odd and the evens
in a list named even.
